**Motivation**

Helios is an important milestone in the development of secure online voting.  As someone who has is involved in running elections this is something I am keen to see being progressed. If people are going to run elections online it is important they use the most secure systems available. Hopefully this documentation helps to make Helios more accessible for those wishing to deploy Helios.
