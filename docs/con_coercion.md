A voter should not be intimidated (coerced) into voting the way the coercer wants.  Democracy depends on individuals being able to freely cast their votes without coercion, bribery or any form of improper influence.  A voter's vote should be secret to protect the voter from coercion:


* **Ballot Secrecy**: the voting system must not reveal who the voter voted for.
* **Receipt-freeness**: the voting system should not give the voter any evidence to prove to a third party how she voted.
* **Coercion-Resistance**: the voter should be able to cast a vote for her intended choice even while appearing to cooperate with a coercer.[^1]
