# Person registers as voter

When an election admin creates an election there is a 'Voters & ballots' section where the admin can choose to:

* allow any member of the public to vote; or,
* upload a list of eligible voters

If the election is open to any member of the public, the voter logs in using one of the Helios authentication options (Google, Facebook etc) prior to casting a vote.

If eligibility is by way of being on a list of eligible voters - this list is uploaded by the election admin at the time of creating the election.  The Helios application does not provide a facility for a person to register as an eligible voter.
